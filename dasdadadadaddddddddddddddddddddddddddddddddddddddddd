Giving all these amazing features and data that switch produces to help us in the decision making regarding to the improvement of the electricity grid in Mexico.


we still facing the fact that most of the stake holders of switch model whom may actually will use all of these generated
data do not have the programming skills needed to take the most of our system.


I take this weakness and and then a create a solution.


I have been designing and developing the foundation of an application that may serve as the graphical user interface for switch.

Hence my goal for this Winter Internship was to create this software seed that from now can be grown with
output and input files gathered for and from Switch

The main tasks to achieve this were :

First of all since our main target is to give this tool to the government sector then it must be an easy way to
visualize the most relevant results of a given scenario

another important to point is that most the Switch data has geospatial attributes And for a better understanding
of the revealed information a human being needs to visualize
this geospatial information not just as a pair of lat long values but as a representation of a portion of
the territory that its under the studied

all of these information that I am talking about comes under .csv, .tab and also as shape files that on a
first glimpse can be overwhelming to see all data with no apparent meaning

So all of these files contains the raw data that we need to crunch in order to produce
those visualizations that we see on the pappers that Dan and Josiah Patty Shuba have bee working on

I mention this because to processing data was one of the biggest challenges that came up while I was working on it

and if we process the data from all those formats and the we create graphs and maps then we will be ready to test out the system


That way I managed to implement three types of visualizations Tables, Graphs and maps

First I analized all the files existing on the records I also ask to experienced contributors to figure out the best way to show the data taking the most
common used files
